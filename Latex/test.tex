\section{Problem 9 --- Joshua Lin}

We are given that the coefficient of volume expansion is defined as 
\[ \beta = \frac{1}{V} \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \]

Knowing that the Ideal Gas Law can be rewritten as 

\[ V = \frac{nRT}{p} \]

we can take a partial derivative with respect to $T$ to arrive at 

\[ \frac{\partial}{\partial T} V = \frac{\partial}{\partial T}\frac{nRT}{p} \]
\[ \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} = \frac{nR}{p} \]

Therefore, 

\[ \beta = \frac{nR}{pV} \]

which, by the Ideal Gas Law, is equivalent to

\[ \beta = \frac{1}{T} \]
