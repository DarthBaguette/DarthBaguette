\section{Creating a Document}
In order to get PDFs and all those other baggage files that come with a bloody LaTeX document, you need to "Build LaTeX project" after going through the normal routine. 

\section{Compiling the PDF}
In order to compile properly, one must: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Save the document
    \item Re-build the project
    \item Refresh all viewers
    \item View in VSCode (or other)
\end{enumerate}
