\subsection{Viscous Resistance}
For a small object dropped vertically in air at relatively low speeds, the drag force is given by $\vec{D}=-b\vec{v}$. The velocity of such an object is given by

\[v = \frac{mg}{b}\left(1-e^{-\frac{bt}{m}}\right)\]

The terminal velocity is reached as t $\rightarrow \infty $, given by

\[v_t = \frac{mg}{b}\]

\subsection{Drag Equation}
For objects dropped at high speeds, the important dependence to remember is that $D \propto v^2 $. Specifically, the motion follows the drag equation: 

\[D = -\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_d A\]
